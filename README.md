## About the Project

This project is the sixth homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project I was asked to create a weather dashboard where a user can search for cities. When the user inputs a city, the dashboard would display the current weather as well as a five day forecast. This city is also added to a list of buttons which can be used to access the weather of that city again. Weather data was accessed using the Open Weather API.

## Benefits of This Project
This project gave me experience is working with APIs. I made three ajax calls to access current weather data, UV index data, and forecast weather data. I was able to successfully create the endpoints for these calls and create callback functions. I gained a lot of experience in traversing JSON objects in order to find the data that I needed. 
## Accessing the Project
